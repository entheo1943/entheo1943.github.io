    <h1>LSD &ndash; Beginner's Guide</h1>

    <em>Last updated on 2025-02-08.</em>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <blockquote>
The biggest misconception about LSD is that you hallucinate actual things:
dinosaurs in cars, cherry trees in the living room. You don't. LSD is all about
perception and perspective. You don't necessarily see large things that are not
there. You see what's always been there in a multitude of new ways. Patterns
emerge in everything. Your mind emphasizes what it used to ignore. Reality
becomes amplified to a staggering degree.<br>
â€” Mark Manson
    </blockquote>

    <p>
LSD is a very powerful substance which must be respected. This guide has the
essential information on the safe usage of LSD. Reading and following this guide
will minimize your chances of experiencing a psychedelic crysis (coloquially
known as a <em>bad trip</em>).
    </p>

    <h2>Serious warnings</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>
Those with a personal or family history of mental disorders, particularly
psychotic disorders like schizophrenia, should not use LSD without consulting a
qualified medical professional. <span class="warn">It can precipitate the early
onset of schizophrenia in vulnerable individuals.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
Do not mix LSD with the following drugs/medication: lithium, tricyclic
antidepressants, tramadol, ritonavir, deliriants (e.g. DPH) and stimulants (e.g.
amphetamine, cocaine). In combination with LSD these drugs can cause <span
class="warn">bad trips, psychosis, seizures, delusions, anxiety, paranoia, panic
attacks and serotonin syndrome.</span>
            </li>
            <li>
Do not cook, swim, drive or operate heavy machinery while under the influence.
            </li>
            <li>
Always test your LSD with a reagent test kit or at least get it from a trusted
source. LSD tests are cheap and legal to buy. Fake LSD mimics (DOx, 25x-NBOMe)
have significantly worse safety profiles than LSD, <span class="warn">including
the risk of physical overdose and death.</span>
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
If no test kit is available, it is advised to immediately spit out any blotters
that have a strong bitter, metallic or chemical-like taste that exceeds a
reasonable level.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
    
    <h2>Dosage and duration</h2>

    <p>
LSD is incredibly potent and dosages are measured in micrograms (&micro;g).
    </p>

    <div style="columns: 2;">
    <ul>
        Dosage:
        <li>Threshold: 15 &micro;g</li>
        <li>Light: 15 &ndash; 75&nbsp;&micro;g</li>
        <li>Common: 75 &ndash; 150&nbsp;&micro;g</li>
        <li>Strong: 150 &ndash; 300&nbsp;&micro;g</li>
        <li>Heavy: >300&nbsp;&micro;g</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        Duration:
        <li>Total: 8 &ndash; 12 hours</li>
        <li>Onset: 15 &ndash; 30 minutes</li>
        <li>Come up: 45 &ndash; 90 minutes</li>
        <li>Peak: 3 &ndash; 5 hours</li>
        <li>Offset: 3 &ndash; 5 hours</li>
        <li>Afterglow: 12 &ndash; 48 hours</li>
    </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Drug combinations</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
Cannabis has a strong and volatile synergy with LSD. It's often used to
intensify or prolong LSD's effects. Combine with cannabis with caution as this
can cause a bad trip, anxiety, paranoia, panic attacks and psychosis.
        </li>
        <li>
Antidepressants, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines reduce the LSD's effects.
Benzodiazepines (e.g. <em>Xanax</em>, <em>Valium</em>) are often used to mellow
down the trip in the case of overwhelming anxiety or psychosis.
        </li>
        <li>
Alcohol &ndash; alcohol's depressant effects can be used to reduce some of the
anxiety and muscle tension produced by LSD. However, alcohol can also cause
dehydration, nausea, and physical fatigue, which can negatively impact the
user's mindset (set).
        </li>
        <li>
MDMA &ndash; LSD synergistically enhances the physical, cognitive, and visual
effects of MDMA. The synergy between these substances is unpredictable and so it
is advised to start with markedly lower doses than one would take for either
individually. <span class="warn">There is some evidence that suggests LSD can
increase the neurotoxicity of MDMA.</span>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Tolerance</h2>

    <p>
LSD is not addictive. There are no withdrawal symptoms when chronic use is
stopped. LSD is not in any way harmful physically to the body. LSD has no known
toxic dose; it is effectively impossible to physically overdose on.
    </p>
    <p>
Common routine drug tests cannot detect LSD in the system. Generally speaking,
LSD will remain in your blood and saliva for up to 24 hours, in your urine for 1
to 3 days, and in your hair for up to 90 days.
    </p>
    <p>
Full tolerance to LSD is formed in as little as 3 hours after ingestion. LSD
also exhibits cross-tolerance with all other psychedelics, meaning that after
the use of LSD, all psychedelics will have a reduced effect.
    </p>
    <p>
It's recommended to wait 10&ndash;14 days between trips for the tolerance to
fully reset. You may use <a
href="https://lsdtolerancecalculator.github.io/">this</a> calculator for a rough
estimate.
    </p>

    <h2>How to ingest</h2>

    <p>
LSD is usually distributed in the form of <em>blotters</em> (aka <em>tabs</em>)
&ndash; small paper squares dipped in a solution of LSD and alcohol. In this
form, LSD is ingested orally, which means you can simply swallow the tabs
    </p>
    <p>
However, people often hold the tabs under the tongue (sublingually) and lightly
chew and suck on them for 15 minutes or until they become soggy, and then
swallow them. Taking LSD sublingually will reduce the waiting time for the
effects, as LSD is absorbed directly into the bloodstream through the lingual
artery.
    </p>
    <p>
Don't drink water 30 minutes before and 30 minutes after ingesting LSD. The
chlorine in the water can completely destroy LSD.
    </p>

    <h2>Tips for a good trip</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>
A first time dose should be around 100&nbsp;&micro;g (1 blotter).
        </li>
        <li>
Have some benzodiazepine on hand (e.g. <em>Xanax</em> &ndash; alprazolam,
<em>Valium</em> &ndash; diazepam) to calm down from a bad trip in the case of
overwhelming anxiety or psychosis. If you have no tolerance to benzodiazepines,
a single medicinal dose should be enough.
<br>
Benzodiazepines will not completely abort a trip, but it will remove anxiety and
the psychedelic thoughts. It will also suppress the stimulating effects of
LSD.
        </li>
        <li>
If inexperienced or when experimenting with large dosages, you may have one
trusted individual as a <em>trip sitter</em> &ndash; a person who stays sober to
ensure safety of the drug user.
        </li>
        <li>
The effects of LSD last for 8-12 hours, depending on the person and the dosage.
It's impossible to sleep while under the influence. Plan your day with that in
mind. It's best to start the trip in the late morning or early afternoon.
        </li>
        <li>
Have no responsibilities or chores nagging you on the day of the trip.
        </li>
        <li>
If you are inexperienced, you should have your trip in a safe, comfortable and
familiar environment.
        </li>
        <li>
Remove any dangerous objects (e.g. guns, knives) from the room.
        </li>
        <li>
Eat a small and healthy meal 1-2 hours before dosing, because you completely
lose apetite under the influence.
        </li>
        <li>
Don't trip if you feel physically unwell or sick. Don't trip if you're depressed
or in a bad mood.
        </li>
        <li>
Use chewing gum to alleviate jaw clenching.
        </li>
        <li>
Have sunglasses ready if you want to hide your dilated pupils from other people
in public.
        </li>
        <li>
Music is essential for a good LSD trip. Prepare a long playlist and have decent
headphones on hand.
        </li>
    </ul>
